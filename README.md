## Flight Schedule Board X, 
### Add-On for MS Flight Simulator X by Saurav Pokhrel

Flight Schedule Board X is an FSX add-on, developed as part of my University Project.
Since there are not many open-source add-ons for FSX (and also PREPAR3D), I am releasing the code
here in GitHub, so that any one who is interested in this project can contribute to it or
fork it to make a newer, better version of the Flight Schedule Board X.
